You seek retribution on those who have wronged you.

A Survivor who blinds you or stuns you using a pallet or locker becomes your Obsession.

Anytime a new Survivor becomes the Obsession, they are affected by the :status{id="oblivious"} status effect for :val{values="40 50 60" unit="seconds"} and their aura is shown to you for :val{values="4" unit="seconds"}.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
