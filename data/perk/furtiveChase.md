You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

You lurk in the shadows, eliminating your victims one by one. When your Obsession is hooked, _Furtive Chase_ receives a token, up to a maximum of :val{values="2 3 4" unit="tokens"}.

Each token decreases your Terror Radius by :val{values="4" unit="meters"} while in a chase.

When a Survivor rescues the Obsession from a hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession. You lose all your tokens if the Obsession is sacrificed or killed.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
