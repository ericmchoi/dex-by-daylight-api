Activatable Perk.

Being within the Killer Terror Radius while not in a chase for :val{values="40 35 30" unit="seconds"} activates _Diversion_.

- Once _Diversion_ is activated, press the _Active Ability_ button while crouched and motionless to throw a pebble, which creates a distraction for The Killer at a distance of :val{values="20" unit="meters"}.
- The perk timer resets once the ability has been activated.

The distraction consists of:

- A loud noise notification
- Scratch marks
