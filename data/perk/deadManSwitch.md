You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

After hooking the Obsession, _Dead Man's Switch_ activates for the next :val{values="35 40 45" unit="seconds"}.

While activated, any Survivor that stops repairing a generator before it is fully repaired causes The Entity to block the generator until _Dead Man's Switch's_ effect ends.

Affected generators are highlighted by a white aura.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
