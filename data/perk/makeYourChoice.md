When a Survivor rescues another from a hook at least :val{values="32" unit="meters"} away from you, _Make your Choice_ causes the Survivor to scream and applies the :status{id="exposed"} status effect to them for :val{values="40 50 60" unit="seconds"}.

_Make your Choice_ has a cooldown of :val{values="40 50 60" unit="seconds"}.
