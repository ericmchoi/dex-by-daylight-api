You've noticed that people pay attention to whatever makes the loudest noise.

After repairing a generator for at least :val{values="3" unit="seconds"}, it will be highlighted to you with a yellow aura. The generator stays highlighted until it is fully repaired, or you repair a new generator, or enter a locker.

Entering any locker will trigger a loud noise indicator for The Killer at the highlighted generator's location.

- _Red Herring_ can only be triggered once every :val{values="60 50 40" unit="seconds"}.
