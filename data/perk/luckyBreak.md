You've had your share of scrapes and bruises, but luck's always on your side.

_Lucky Break_ activates any time you are injured. While _Lucky Break_ is active, you won't leave trails of blood or scratch marks for a total of :val{values="40 50 60" unit="seconds"}.

_Lucky Break_ is permanently deactivated for the remainder of the Trial once the total duration has elapsed.
