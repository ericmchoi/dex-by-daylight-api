Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability.

Any regressing generator will be highlighted by a white aura. If the regression is interrupted on a generator, it will be highlighted by a yellow aura for :val{values="8 12 16" unit="seconds"}.

Noises created by generator repairs are audible at an additional :val{values="8" unit="meters"}.
