Lady Luck always seems to be throwing something good your way.

When retrieving an item from a chest, there is a :val{values="100" unit="%"} chance that a :val{values="Very Rare"} (or lower) add-on will be attached to it.

:val{values="10 25 50" unit="%"} chance of finding an add-on of :val{values="Uncommon"} rarity or lower.

When escaping, keep any add-ons your item has.
