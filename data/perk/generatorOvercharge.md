You are fuelled by your hate for progress.

Overcharge a generator by performing the **Damage Generator** action. The next Survivor interacting with that generator is faced with a :val{values="tremendously"} difficult Skill Check. Failing the Skill Check results in an additional :val{values="3 4 5" unit="%"} loss of progress.

Succeeding the Skill Check grants no progress but prevents the generator explosion.
