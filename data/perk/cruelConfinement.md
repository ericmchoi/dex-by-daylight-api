Your ties to the otherworldly manifest when your prey attempts to get away.

Every time a generator is completed, all windows and vault locations within a :val{values="32" unit="meter radius"} of the completed generator are blocked for all Survivors for the next :val{values="20 25 30" unit="seconds"}.

You see the aura of the vault locations blocked by _Cruel Limits_ for the duration.
