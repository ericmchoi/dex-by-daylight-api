When your mind is set, there better be no one standing in your way.

While standing in a locker for :val{values="3" unit="seconds"}, _Head On_ activates.

While _Head On_ is activated, perform a rush action to leave a locker to use _Head On_. If The Killer is standing within _Head On's_ effective range, The Killer is stunned for :val{values="3" unit="seconds"}.

Causes the :status{id="exhausted"} status effect for :val{values="60 50 40" unit="seconds"}.

_Head On_ cannot be used while :status{id="exhausted"}.

You do not recover from the :status{id="exhausted"} status effect while running.

_Head On_ cannot be used when you have idle crows.
