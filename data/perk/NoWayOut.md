You're not going to let just anyone into the VIP room.

After hooking a Survivor for the first time, _No Way Out_ gains a token. **Once the exit gates have been powered**, _No Way Out_ activates.

- **When a Survivor interacts with an exit gate switch, you receive a loud noise notification.** The Entity then blocks both exit gate switches for :val{values="12" unit="seconds"} plus an additional :val{values="6 9 12" unit="seconds"} for each token in your possession.
