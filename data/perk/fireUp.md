The increased pressure of losing your prey fills you with anger and gives you unsuspected motivation.

Each time the Survivors complete repairs on a generator, _Fire Up_ grows in power.

- For each generator completed, gain a :val{values="3 3.5 4" unit="%"} stackable buff that grants a speed bonus to picking up, dropping, vaulting, damaging generators, and breaking pallets for the remainder of the trial.
