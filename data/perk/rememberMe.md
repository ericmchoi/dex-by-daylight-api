You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

Each time you hit your Obsession with a _basic attack_, you increase the opening time of the exit gates by :val{values="4" units="seconds"} up to a maximum of :val{values="8 12 16" unit="additional seconds"}.

The Obsession is not affected by _Remember Me_.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
