Your vault speed is :val{values="5 10 15" unit="%"} faster.

Performing a vault action calls upon The Entity to block that vault location for :val{values="8 12 16" unit="seconds"}.

Only 1 vault location may be blocked in this way at any time. The vault location is blocked only for Survivors.

Does not affect pallets.
