As soon as an exit gate is opened, Blood Warden is activated. The auras of any Survivors located within Exit areas are revealed to you.

Once per match, hooking a Survivor while Blood Warden is active calls upon The Entity to block both Exits for all Survivors for :val{values="30 40 60" unit="seconds"}.
