You've got an ear for well-oiled gears.

After hitting a Survivor :val{values="2"} times with your _basic attack_, _Gearhead_ activates for :val{values="20 25 30" unit="seconds"}.

While _Gearhead_ is active, each time a Survivor completes a Good Skill Check while repairing, the generator will be revealed by a yellow aura for as long as it is being repaired.
