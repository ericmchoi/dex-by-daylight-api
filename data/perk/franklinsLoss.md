Your vicious attacks make Survivors drop their item on impact.

While on the ground, it takes up to {values="150 120 90" unit="seconds"} for the item to **lose all of its charges** if it is not picked up.

Reveal items on the ground within :val{values="32" unit="meters"} with a white aura. The Aura will slowly fade to red until the Item is empty of charges.
