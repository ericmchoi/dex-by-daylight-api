When direct combat isn't an option, you still find ways to strike back.

_Blast Mine_ activates after completing a total of {values="66" unit="%"} worth of repair progress on generators.

After repairing a generator for at least {values="3" unit="seconds"}, press the _Ability button_ to install a trap which stays active for {values="35 40 45" unit="seconds"}. Affected generators will be revealed to all Survivors by a yellow aura. Only one trap can be active on a generator.

- When the Killer damages a trapped generator, the trap explodes, stunning them and blinding anyone nearby. _Blast Mine_ is then deactivated.
