You stand up for yourself, using whatever's on hand to gain an advantage.

Press and hold the _Active Ability button_ for :val{values="4" unit="seconds"} while standing beside a dropped pallet to reset it to its upright position.

_Any Means Necessary_ has a cooldown of :val{values="100 80 60" unit="seconds"}.
