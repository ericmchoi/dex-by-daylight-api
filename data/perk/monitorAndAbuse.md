Meticulous in your approach, terrifying in your application.

While in a chase, your Terror Radius is increased by :val{values="8" unit="meters"}. Otherwise, your Terror Radius is decreased by :val{values="8" unit="meters"} and your field of view is increased by :val{values="3 5 10" unit="degrees"}.

_Field of view gains do not stack._
