A deep bond with The Entity unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability.

After hooking a Survivor, all other Survivors' auras are revealed to you for :val{values="4" unit="seconds"} when they are further than :val{values="40" unit="meters"} from the hook.

- Each time that a Survivor is hooked for the first time, gain a :val{values="25" unit="%"} stackable bonus to all bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of :val{values="50 75 100" unit="%"}.
- The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-trial.
