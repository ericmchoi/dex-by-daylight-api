You're able to organize a team to cooperate more efficiently.

Increases other Survivors' healing, sabotage, unhooking, cleansing, opening exit gates, and chest unlocking speeds by :val{values="15 20 25" unit="%"} when they are within a :val{values="8" unit="meter"} range from you.

Survivors can only be affected by one _Leader_ effect at a time.

This effect persists on other Survivors for :val{values="15" unit="seconds"} after leaving the Leader's effective perk range.
