Life has been difficult for you, so you'll make it difficult for others.

When you damage a generator, up to :val{values="3"} other random generators also begin regressing.

If the affected generators are being repaired, any Survivors repairing them receive a difficult Skill Check.

_Oppression_ has a cooldown of :val{values="120 100 80" unit="seconds"}.
