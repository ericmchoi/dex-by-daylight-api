You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

Every time you chase your Obsession and let them escape, you receive a token up to a maximum of 3 tokens.

Each token increases your movement speed by :val{values="3 4 5" unit="%"}.

Performing a _basic attack_ or _Special Attack_ spends one token.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
