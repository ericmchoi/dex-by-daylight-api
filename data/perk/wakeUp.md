Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability.

Once all generators are powered, exit gates are revealed to you within a :val{values="128" unit="meter"} range. While opening the exit gates, reveal your aura to other Survivors up to :val{values="128" unit="meters"}.

While _Wake Up!_ is active, you open the exit gates :val{values="5 10 15" unit="%"} faster.
