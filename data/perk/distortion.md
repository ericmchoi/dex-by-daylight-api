You start the trial with :val{values="3" unit="tokens"}.

When your aura would be shown to The Killer, _Distortion_ activates and a token is consumed.

For the next :val{values="6 8 10" unit="seconds"} while _Distortion_ is activated, you do not leave scratch marks and your aura will not be shown to The Killer.

- _Distortion_ does not activate when you are in the dying state or in a trap.
