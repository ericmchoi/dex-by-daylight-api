Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability. Paranoia paired with the horror for failure drives you to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

The auras of :val{values="3"} generators which are in close proximity to one another are revealed to you for :val{values="30 45 60" unit="seconds"}, at the start of the match and each time a generator is completed. If you are holding a map that can track generators, generators revealed by _Deja Vu_ are added to the map.
