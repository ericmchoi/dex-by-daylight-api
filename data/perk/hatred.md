You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

Each time a generator is completed, your Obsession (a Survivor) sees your aura for :val{values="5 4 3" unit="seconds"}.

Each time a generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for :val{values="3" unit="seconds"}.

Once all generators are completed, the Obsession has the :status{id="exposed"} status effect and you can :val{values="kill"} your obsession.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
