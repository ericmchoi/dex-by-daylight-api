The NE-Î± parasite provides you with the intelligence and awareness needed to set a trap.

After kicking a generator, its aura is highlighted in yellow.

- Whenever a Survivor enters the dying state, every affected generator explodes, losing :val{values="6" unit="%"} worth of progress and starts to regress.
- Any Survivor repairing a generator when it explodes will scream and suffer from the :status{id="incapacitated"} status effect for :val{values="12 14 16" unit="seconds"}.

_Eruption_ has a cooldown of :val{values="30" unit="seconds"}.
