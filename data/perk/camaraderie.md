Life has taught you the importance of friendship which has given you strength.

While you are on the hook in the struggle phase, _Camaraderie_ activates.

If another Survivor is within :val{values="16" unit="meters"} of you while _Camaraderie_ is activated, the hook timer is paused for :val{values="26 30 34" unit="seconds"}.
