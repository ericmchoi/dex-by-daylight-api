You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

Your Obsession gains a :val{values="33" unit="%"} action speed bonus to unhooking and healing other Survivors.

Each time you hook a Survivor other than the Obsession, if the Obsession is alive, gain a token.

If the Obsession is alive, all Survivors who are not the Obsession get :val{values="2 2.5 3" unit="%"} penalty to repair, healing and sabotage speeds for each token.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
