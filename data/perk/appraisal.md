You have a careful eye that notices what many overlook.

Start the trial with :val{values="3" unit="tokens"}. When a chest has already been opened, consume a token to rummage through it for an item. Rummaging can only be performed once per chest.

You rummage through chests :val{values="40 60 80" unit="%"} faster.
