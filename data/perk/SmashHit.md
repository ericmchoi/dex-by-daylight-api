When your rival makes a mistake, you seize the opportunity.

After stunning the Killer with a pallet, break into a sprint at :val{values="150" unit="%"} your normal running speed for :val{values="4" unit="seconds"}.

Causes the :status{id="exhausted"} status effect for :val{values="60 50 40" unit="seconds"}.

This perk cannot be used while :status{id="exhausted"}.
