It's as if a latent part of yourself has awakened. You feel like you can reach out beyond yourself for assistance.

When you or the Obsession are injured, you both see each other's auras.

After completing a healing action on the Obsession, or having the Obsession complete a healing action on you, you both gain a :val{values="5 6 7" unit="%"} :status{id="speed"} status effect until no longer within :val{values="16" unit="m"} of each other.

Reduces the odds of being the Obsession.

If you are the Obsession, this perk deactivates.
