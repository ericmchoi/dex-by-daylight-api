You guide your victims along a path of pain and punishment.

After kicking a generator, you become :status{id="undetectable"} until the generator stops regressing or a Survivor is injured or put into the dying state by any means. During this time, the generator's yellow aura is revealed to Survivors.

This effect can only trigger once every :val{values="80 70 60" unit="seconds"}.
