  "Charge from the Belly of the Beast" Here's a sketch/paining on a piece of wood I saw by the side of the road. I felt like it got a story to tell. And it didn't waste its second chance. -Jeff, ink and oil wash on slice of wood, 12x16

Any time you are removed from a hook (escaped or saved), the hook breaks and the Killer's aura is shown to you for :val{values="4 5 6" unit="seconds"}. A hook broken by this perk takes :val{values="180" unit="seconds"} to respawn.
