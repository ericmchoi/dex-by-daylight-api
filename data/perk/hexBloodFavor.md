A Hex that gains The Entity's favor when blood is spilled.

When a Survivor is hit with a _basic attack_, pallets within :val{values="16" unit="meters"} of your location are held in place by The Entity for :val{values="15" unit="seconds"}. These pallets cannot be pulled down.

_Hex: Blood Favor_ has a cooldown of :val{values="60 50 40" unit="seconds"}.
