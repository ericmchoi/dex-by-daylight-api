A deep bond with The Entity unlocks great strength.

After hooking a Survivor, the next generator you damage instantly loses :val{values="25" unit="%"} of its progress. Normal generator regression applies after the Damage Generator action.

_Pop Goes the Weasel_ is active for :val{values="35 40 45" unit="seconds"} after the Survivor is hooked.
