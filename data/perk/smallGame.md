You have the undeniable capability to sense danger.

Get an auditory warning when looking in the direction of Totems in a :val{values="45" unit="degree"} cone within a range of :val{values="8 10 12" unit="meters"}. _Small Game_ has a cooldown of :val{values="15 12 10" unit="seconds"} each time it activates.

For each Dull Totem and Hex Totem cleansed by any player, gain a Token. Small Game's detection cone is reduced by :val{values="5" unit="degrees"} per token.
