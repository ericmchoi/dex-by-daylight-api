A Hex rooting its power in despair. Your hunt is an irresistible song of dread which muddles your prey's attention.

Survivors receive a :val{values="2 4 6" unit="%"} regression penalty when missing a Skill Check while healing or repairing.

Each time a Survivor is hooked, Huntress Lullaby grows in power. It affects healing and repairing Skill Check warnings:

- **1 to 4 Tokens:** Time between the Skill Check warning sound and the Skill Check becomes shorter.
- **5 Tokens:** No Skill Check warning.

_The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing._
