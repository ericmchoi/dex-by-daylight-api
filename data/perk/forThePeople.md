You risk life and injury for others.

_For the People_ is only active while at full health.

Press the _Active Ability_ button while healing another Survivor without a med kit to instantly heal them from dying to injured, or from injured to healthy.

You become injured and receive the :status{id="broken"} status effect for :val{values="110 100 90" unit="seconds"}.

You become the Obsession.

Equipping this perk **decreases** your chances to be The Killer's Obsession at the start of the trial.
