You become **obsessed** with one Survivor.

Earn a token for each successful _basic attack_ that is not dealt to the Obsession.

Each token grants a stackable :val{values="5" unit="%"} decreased successful _basic attack_ cooldown, you can earn up to :val{values="8"} tokens.

Hitting your Obsession with a _basic attack_ will cause you to lose :val{values="4 3 2"} tokens.

You can no longer gain tokens if your Obsession is sacrificed or killed.

- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
