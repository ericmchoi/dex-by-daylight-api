It is inconceivable to leave someone behind.

Once at least one exit gate is opened, you gain the following effects:

- :val{values="50 75 100" unit="%"} additional Bloodpoints for healing and unhooking other Survivors.
- :val{values="30 40 50" unit="%"} bonus action speed when healing and unhooking other Survivors.
- The auras of all other Survivors are revealed to you.
