You're accustomed to being hunted by malicious forces, and you've begun using it to your advantage.

_Repressed Alliance_ activates after repairing generators for a total of :val{values="80 70 60" unit="seconds"}.

When repairing a generator while the perk is active, press the _Active Ability_ button to call upon The Entity to block the generator for :val{values="30" unit="seconds"}. The perk deactivates.

Affected generators will be revealed by a white aura to all Survivors.
