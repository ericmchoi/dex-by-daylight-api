  "A Mercy that Rips the Storm" Oil work to honor my best buddies who happen to be the best musicians I know. Their first album is still my favorite. It got me through a dark time in my life. -Jeff, oil on canvas, 16x16

Unlocks potential in one's aura-reading ability.

You see the aura of every Survivor that:

- You rescue from a hook, or rescues you from a hook;
- You complete a healing action on, or completes a healing action on you.

They also see your aura.

This occurs for up to :val{values="1 2 3" unit="Survivors"}. All effects for _Aftercare_ are reset when you are hooked by The Killer.
