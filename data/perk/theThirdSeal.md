A Hex that hinders one's aura reading ability.

Hitting a Survivor with a _basic attack_ while the Hex Totem is active applies the :status{id="vision"} status effect. This effect applies to the last :val{values="2 3 4"} Survivors hit.

_The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing._
