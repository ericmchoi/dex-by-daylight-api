Sometimes the sacrifice of others is necessary to get ahead.

Whenever another Survivor is hooked, you gain :val{values="1 2 3" unit="tokens"}.

You consume all tokens after a great Skill Check on a generator. Each token consumed grants a :val{values="1" unit="%"} bonus progression for great Skill Checks when repairing generators.
