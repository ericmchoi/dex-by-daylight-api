Evil has a way of always finding you.

After you earn :val{values="3"} Protection Hit scoring events, _Mettle of Man_ activates.

Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the **dying state** from the **injured state** is ignored.

The next time you heal back to full health, your aura will be revealed to the Killer when you are further than :val{values="12 14 16" unit="meters"} from the Killer.

_Mettle of Man_ will deactivate the next time you are put into the dying state.

- _Increases your chances of being The Killer's Obsession._
- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
