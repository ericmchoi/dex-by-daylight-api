You start the trial with a :val{values="-25" unit="%"} progress penalty for Skill Checks to heal Survivors.

For every successful Skill Check while healing a Survivor, you receive a token up to a maximum of :val{values="3 4 5" unit="tokens"}.

Each token grants you a :val{values="+15" unit="%"} progress bonus.

Great Skill Checks cannot be performed while using _Autodidact_.

- _Autodidact_ is not active when using a Med Kit to heal.
