After performing a safe hook rescue on another Survivor, _Deliverance_ activates.

You now have a :val{values="100" unit="%"} chance of unhooking yourself during the escape attempt.

A successful _Deliverance_ from the hook triggers the :status{id="broken"} status effect for :val{values="100 80 60" unit="seconds"}.
