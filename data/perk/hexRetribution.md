A Hex that lashes out upon its destruction. Those who cross you will be punished.

Any Survivor who cleanses a Dull Totem will suffer from the :status{id="oblivious"} status effect for :val{values="35 40 45" unit="seconds"}.

If any Hex Totem is cleansed, including this one, the auras of all Survivors are revealed for :val{values="10" unit="seconds"}.
