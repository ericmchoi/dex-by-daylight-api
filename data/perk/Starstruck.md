Your unmatched showmanship dazzles all.

While carrying a Survivor, any other Survivors within your Terror Radius suffer from the :status{id="exposed"} status effect.

The effect persists for :val{values="26 28 30" unit="seconds"} on Survivors who leave your Terror Radius, as well as those within the radius when you hook or release the carried Survivor.

_Starstruck_ has a cooldown of :val{values="60" unit="seconds"} once a Survivor is no longer carried.
