As more of your friends fall to the Killer, you become shrouded in isolation and the Killer's **aura reading abilities** towards you are disrupted.

Every time a fellow Survivor is killed or sacrificed, gain a token. For each token, your aura cannot be read by The Killer within a max range of :val{values="20 22 24" unit="meters"} for each **killed** or **sacrificed** Survivor.

- _Increases your chances of being The Killer's Obsession._
- _The Killer can only be **obsessed** with one Survivor at a time._
