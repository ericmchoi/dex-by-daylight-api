You look inward and trust your instincts when you feel lost and alone.

Each time you complete a Totem cleanse action, _Inner Strength_ activates. If you are already afflicted by the :status{id="broken"} status effect, _Inner Strength_ does not activate.

While _Inner Strength_ is active, hiding inside a locker for :val{values="10 9 8" unit="seconds"} while injured automatically heals you from injured to healthy.

_Inner Strength_ becomes deactivated as soon as it has successfully triggered.
