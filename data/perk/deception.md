Your adventurous lifestyle requires moments of craft misdirection.

Interacting with a locker while sprinting will trigger a loud noise notification at your location and cause you to leave no scratch marks for :val{values="3" unit="seconds"}.

You no longer enter lockers while spriting and while this perk is active.

_Deception_ can only be trigger onced every :val{values="60 50 40" unit="seconds"}.
