Your prayers invoke a dark power that meddles with the Survivor's chances of survival.

:val{values="3" unit="generators"} located furthest from you are blocked by The Entity for :val{values="80 100 120" unit="seconds"} at the start of the trial.

Survivors cannot repair these generators for the duration. Affected generators are highlighted by a white aura.
