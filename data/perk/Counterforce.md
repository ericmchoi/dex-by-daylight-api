You know how to withstand an enemy stronger than you, and it start with hunting down and knocking out their support.

You cleanse totems {values="20" unit="%"} faster. After cleansing a totem, you see the aura of the furthest totem from you for {values="2 3 4" unit="seconds"} and you gain an additional {values="20" unit="%"} stackable speed bonus to cleansing totems for the remainder of the trial.
