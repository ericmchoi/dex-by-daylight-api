While _Hex: Undying_ is active, Survivors within :val{values="2 3 4" unit="meters"} of any totem have their aura revealed.

When another Hex Totem is cleansed, that Totem's Hex transfers to the _Hex: Undying_ Totem, deactivating _Hex: Undying_. Any tokens the transferred Hex had are transferred as well.
